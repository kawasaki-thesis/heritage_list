West Norwegian Fjords ? Geirangerfjord and Naroyfjord,,"More og Romsdal, ?Norway 62‹7Œ00N 7‹10Œ00E? / ?62.11667‹N 7.16667‹E","Natural: (vii), (viii)",?,2005,"Situated in south-western Norway, north-east of Bergen, Geirangerfjord and Naroyfjord, set 120?km from one another, are part of the west Norwegian fjord landscape, which stretches from Stavanger in the south to Andalsnes, 500?km to the north-east. The two fjords, among the worldfs longest and deepest, are considered as archetypical fjord landscapes and among the most scenically outstanding anywhere. Their exceptional natural beauty is derived from their narrow and steep-sided crystalline rock walls that rise up to 1,400 m from the Norwegian Sea and extend 500 m below sea level. The sheer walls of the fjords have numerous waterfalls while free-flowing rivers cross their deciduous and coniferous forests to glacial lakes, glaciers and rugged mountains. The landscape features a range of supporting natural phenomena, both terrestrial and marine, such as submarine moraines and marine mammals. [52]"
